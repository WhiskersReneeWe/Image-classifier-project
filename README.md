# Flower Images classifier - A deep learning project

__Motivation__

This project is one of the most challenging projects within Udacity's Data Science NanoDegree projects. In this project (for me), the deepest learning curve is to learn to use Pytorch to create fascinating deep neural network by training a large image dataset. Afterwards, the next deep learning curve is to use argparse to package the model into a neat command-line application. 

The process of completing this project was a long winding one, but the end result truly rendered a massive satisfaction in this journey. I truly hope my experience of successfully creating this deep learning (DL) without knowing anything about it beforehand can encourage many of you to embark on this fascinating, albeit very challenging, journey.

 __What is this project about?__

As I mentioned in the Motivation section, the end product of this project is a trained Neural Network which classifies an incoming flower image into one of the available labels. Specifically, this model is created using __transfer learing__ method, where I used VGG16 as the based model to start with.  

The hyperparameters are then fine tuned using the training dataset. The end product is a Neural Network classifier that can be accessed and executed through a simple command line. The input is the image path which leads to the flower image, and the output you shall see is the name of this predicted flower type and a display of the top 5 most likely labels available. Pretty cool, huh?

__Python Packages Used__:

* argpase
* numpy 
* time
* copy
* torch
* matplotlib.pyplot
* torchvision
* json

__Acknowledgement__


Without Udacity's Data Science team and patient mentor,  I wouldn't be able to tackle this challenge on my own. I truly am grateful with this hands-on project itself (I really gained so much knowledge on deep learning compared to where I started this), and Udacity!

This project is only for practicing/self-learning purpose. All the errors are solely mine.
